# Machine learning with California housing dataset

This repository is a collection of python code that provide an introduction to machine learning using the California Housing dataset. 
The repository contains several notebooks, each covering a different aspect of the machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

It covers data preparation, custom transformers, pipelines and linear regression. The notebook begins with loading the California Housing dataset and exploring its structure and attributes. 
It then proceeds to perform data preprocessing tasks, including feature scaling, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

The notebook then introduces linear regression as a method for predicting house prices based on the other attributes in the dataset.
It uses scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to implement linear regression and evaluate its performance on the test set. 
The notebook also includes visualizations to help understand the relationships between the different attributes and the target variable.
